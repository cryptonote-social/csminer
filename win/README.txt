csminer v0.3.3 (Windows version)

SYNOPSIS

csminer from https://cryptonote.social is an easy-to-use CPU miner for Monero intended to provide
"set it and forget it" mining for your existing laptop and desktop machines. By default, csminer
mines with a single thread, and only when the screen is locked or the screensaver is running. On a
laptop, csminer will mine only when on AC power to avoid draining the battery. It can be
configured to always mine or mine with more threads using the options described below.


USAGE

./csminer [OPTION]...

All arguments are optional:
  -user <string>
        your pool username from https://cryptonote.social/xmr (default "donate-getmonero-org")
  -saver=<bool>
        mine only when screen is locked or the screensaver is running (default true)
  -exclude <string>
        pause mining during the specified hours. Format is XX-YY where XX and YY are hours of
        the day designated in 24 hour time. For example, -exclude=11-16 will pause mining betwen
        11:00am and 4:00pm. This can be used, for example, to pause mining during times of high
        machine usage or high electricity rates.
  -threads <int>
        number of threads (default 1)
  -rigid <string>
        your rig id (default "csminer")
  -tls=<bool>
        whether to use TLS when connecting to the pool (default false)
  -config <string>
        advanced pool config option string, for specifying starting diff, donation percentage,
        email address for notifications, and more. See "advanced configuration options" under Get
        Started on the pool site for details. Some options will require you to also specify your
        wallet id (see below) in order to be changed.
  -wallet <string>
        your wallet id. You only need to specify this when establishing a new username, or if
        specifying a 'secure' config parameter change such as a new pool donation amount or email
        address. New usernames will be established upon submitting at least one valid share.

Monitor your miner progress at: https://cryptonote.social/xmr, or type <p> + <enter> to display
pool stats in the command shell.

Tips:

Under Windows Power & Sleep settings, set "When plugged in, PC goes to
sleep after" to Never.

For best performance, if csminer reports it's unable to allocate hugepages, try restarting your
machine and starting csminer before running anything else.

Consider putting a shortcut to csminer in your Windows Startup folder (see:
https://helpdeskgeek.com/windows-10/how-to-access-the-windows-10-startup-folder/) so that it starts
automatically.

If you don't specify a username, csminer will mine on behalf of the Monero project
(https://donate.getmonero.org) with earnings going directly to its wallet:

ADDITIONAL DETAILS

Usernames

If you don't already have a username established with the pool, you can create one by simply
specifying your wallet id with the -wallet option along with your selected username, e.g.:

csminer.exe -user=your-chosen-username -wallet=your-wallet-id

Once you've submitted at least one share, the wallet address is permanently associated with the
username and you can login with the username alone, e.g.:

csminer.exe -user=your-chosen-username

Implementation

csminer utilizes the RandomX implementation from https://github.com/tevador/RandomX and will
perform similarly to other mining software based on this library such as xmrig.
